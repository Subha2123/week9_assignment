# MAP MARKER ANIMATION

This repository is a sample project to demonstrate how to move marker (any type) on a specifiq path on the google map. Since since it's a required feature when implementing or drawing a path bettween two point.
A library for adding animated marker clusters to Google, Mapbox.

Steps for making animation

1.Create a Mapbox account and get the access token
2.Add the access token to the mapboxgl instance defined in the mapanimation.js
3.Create a marker and add it to the map using the mapboxgl pre-built functions.
4.The function move() is called when the button "Show stops between MIT and Harvard" is selected. This is how you can start the marker animation.
5.If your code works, you should be able to see a marker moving from one bus stop to the next on the map.

When we should click the start button the marker should move for the destination for a particular timeout.
In this project setTimeout function shuold be implemented.
